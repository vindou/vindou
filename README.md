### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Chang.

I'm an undergraduate at Purdue University, working at the [Computational Motion, Manipulation, and Autonomy (CoMMA) lab](https://commalab.org/), advised by Dr. Zachary Kingston.

I study computer science and mechanical engineering.

Passionate about electromechanical systems, classical control theory, numerical methods, and robotics.
