            <p class = "box-content"> As NASA astronaut Frank Borman once said, “Exploration really is the essence of the human spirit, and to pause, to falter, to turn our back on the quest for knowledge, is to perish.” When the entirety of humanity is living on a wet rock, it seems only natural to look up and see the places we could go. I’m pursuing a career in Aerospace Engineering to develop the first step in getting to this new frontier.

                Because I’m striving to become an aerospace engineer, it seems natural to me to begin developing those skills relevant to an engineer. In my time at Dublin High School, I’ve engaged in many activities relevant to the field I’m pursuing, including three different robotics competitions and a math and science olympiad. All of these activities served to broaden my exposure to the STEM field and build networking skills
                
                Among these activities stands my favorite: robotics. I’ve competed on our school team, Gael Force Robotics, being a member of teams 5327C and 5327D and eventually rising to the position of team captain of 5327K. Through meeting other competitors in the VEX Robotics Competition, I  was eventually invited to work with some other competitors on a 15-pound combat robot. Robotics exposed me to various aspects of engineering, such as the basic principles of power transfer, giving me a launching pad to explore the field even more. Besides technical expertise, Gael Force Robotics has also allowed me to develop my leadership skills. As a team captain, I’ve learned to assess multiple factors: our team’s technical skill, its relation with other teams, and our financial status (expenses, funds, etc.) I’ve also learned to express my opinion on club-wide issues, advising fellow officers on issues that seem to be “not my problem.”
                
                Ultimately, I hope these activities will evolve from a small step into a giant leap for me, allowing me to become an engineer.
